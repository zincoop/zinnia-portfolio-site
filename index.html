							<h1>Zinnia Cooperrider</h1>
							<p class="major">Designing for Play and the Natural World</p></a></p>
							<!-- Mention the fantastical? Exploring different mediums and styles sounds like a platitude. Get specific. She's made projects from bottle caps, yarn, metal scales, PLA, fabric, and everything in between.-->
							<!-- Zinnia wants to help companies design products that help leave our planet better than we found it. Lots of ways to say this- idk the best one. Just be a little more concrete in your aim.
							Maybe you just say exactly what sustainable attributes you want to prioritize. Now, Zinnia wants to help companies design durable products made from sustainable materials.-->
							<p>Born in Flagstaff, Arizona to an artistic family, Zinnia has spent her life exploring different materials, such as bottle caps, wood, yarn, metal scales, PLA, and more. She draws much of her inspiration from fantasy and playful interaction with the world. Now earning a degree in Design at Stanford University, Zinnia wants to help companies make their products sustainable, and make a concious effort to leave this planet better than it is now.</p>

										<p>This press was CNC milled to fit large scalemail scales. The inside pieces can be removed and replaced for different patterns and fit precisely into the well of the press. Once a scale is placed between the pieces, pressure is applied to the press and the scale is imprinted with the veins of a leaf.</p>

										<h3>Abstract Earrings</h3>
										<p>Pierced 1.2 mm sheet silver. I was given a 1in square piece of material, and had to figure out how to cut both earring shapes out of it. I soldered 8x10mm bezel cups to them and set the onyx cabachons. They were then sanded, engraved, and pin finished for the final textured look.</p>

The game plays off the Apples to Apples style of judging games, but uses more of an improv slant. Players pick an adjective and noun pair to act out for the judge, competing for a "Bloobie Award."</p>

Pierced out of 1mm silver sheet, the design was inspired by the animated show Avatar: The Last Airbender. I was challenged by the difficuly of piercing the center swirl evenly in one go, but I'm pretty satisfied with how it turned out.</p>

										<h3>Fantasy Cloak</h3>
										<p>I sewed this cloak for a friend (pictured). In order to make it as long as she is tall, I drafted a pattern that split the cloak into panels. However, this created a secondary difficulty of matching the fabric patterns on each panel to make it look more seamless. This was the second of five cloaks that I've made, though the rest were with non-patterned fabrics.</p>

										<h3>Formal Dress</h3>
										<p>A dress I sewed for a ball at my Stanford dorm. I wanted to make an elegant dress that fit me well, so I found a pattern I like and tailored it to fit better. This was one of the more challenging fabrics I've worked with, and I found making it look nice enough for formal wear required a high degree of precision.</p>

										<h3>Moon Automoton</h3>
										<p>An exercise in mechanisms and precision with imprecise materials. The challenge was to create an automota out of foamcore that incorporated at least 4 different mechanisms, and still could be decorated in the same thematic genre. While time consuming to make sure that it worked, I really enjoyed the simple complexity of foamcore construction and paper crafting decorations.</p>

										<p>One of many planters that my family and I made for the Flagstaff Recycled Arts show in 2011. We spent weeks collecting caps, pounding them flat, and cleaning them. My job was to trace the petal shapes and later help arrange and glue them in place. When the planters were presented at the show, the head of the local arboretum told us that he could identify many of the flowers from across the room.</p>

My dad and I spent many hours dumpster diving for the best bottles (and getting strange looks). Each bottle has a turned wooden cap representing it's position, as well as a sandblasted insignia. The pieces are partially filled with sand to give them weight. </p>

										<p>One of my family's traditions is that we make our own Christmas trees. Last year we decided to make a reusable one that we could modify in the future. This tree consists of a large wooden dowel, and 22 different sized "leaves." Each leaf is held separate by a spacer and can be moved around the tree for different formations, or removed for easy transport.</p>
