                                <p>PMDP is non-profit organization that removes ghost nets (fishing nets that have been dumped into the ocean) from the Papahanaumokuakea Marine Nation Monument (PMNM). In a two-quarter long project, my team worked with them to figure out a new material stream for the thousands of tons of nets that PMDP was pulling out of the ocean. We had a remarkable degree of freedom in this project, as PDMP didn't have a specific direction they wanted us to take. We connected with their partner, the Center for Marine Debris Research (CMDR), to help with their research, which is currently to determine the strength of recycled plastic that could be made from the retrieved nets, and what it could be used for. You can learn more about PMDP or CMDR and their work by clicking below.</p>

                                <h4>Initial Research</h4>
                                <p>Our first step was to research what ghost nets were, what materials they tended to be made of, and what was currently happening with them. As we didn't have a specific project to start, we needed a good idea of what was out there and what was missing, in case we could fill any gaps. This meant reading a ton of research papers about ghost net plastics and their properties and meeting with many other organizations doing similar research to recycle discarded fishing nets.</p>
        
                                <h4>Project Planning</h4>
                                <p><span class="image right" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="images/PMDP/ghost nets.png" alt="" /></span>With all of our information gathered, and a bit of discussion with CMDR, we settled on helping them test the properties of recycled plastic made from shredded net material. As Stanford students (and the Materials Science connections of one of our teammates), we had access to some expensive specialized testing equipment that could supplement CMDR's research. In order to be able to test the nets, we needed to make shred them, then compress or extrude the shreds into the testing shape (called a dog bone), then load them into the tester. We would test the process on nets from another class's project while CMDR sorted and sent us samples of their nets.</p>

                                <h3>Dog Bones Creation</h3>
                            </header>
                            <div class="content">
        
                                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                                <p><span class="image right" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="images/PMDP/generic dog bones.jpg" alt="" /></span>There were two ways we could melt the shreds to create the dogbones. The first would be to extrude them from a machine that would melt, compress, and mix the plastic, then push it out into either a sheet or (ideally) our preferred shape. Unfortunately, the extruders we had access to were either nonfunctional or we were unable to use recycled material in them. Our second option was to use pressure and heat to take the scaps and melt them together into either a sheet or our preferred shape. We had access to a heat press, and determined that would work best. Ideally, we could make a mold, determine how much shred would fill the mold, add our measured and shredded nets, and compress it nicely into the mold.</p>
        
                                <h4>Mold Making</h4>
                                <p><span class="image left" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="images/ALA/waterjet progress.jpg" alt="" /></span>After measuring and prototyping to make sure pieces would be the correct size, I started cutting out the feathers, upper wing sets, and a connection piece that would affix everything to the cast backpiece. I had also originally wanted to curve the feathers, be after a couple of tests, decided that I preferred the flat feathers, as they stakced better and added the dimensionality I wanted to the wings. I cut the sheet on both a waterjet (see left) and a high powered laser cutter. I then sanded out all the sharp edges, except the feather points, and finished eahc piece. The finishing took far longer than I had anticipated, as all of the pieces had to be taken to a low grit to look consitent, and then the feathers were pin finished, where each feather took an average of about four minutes (yes I counted).</p>
        
                                <h4>Casting</h4>
                                <p><span class="image right" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="images/ALA/finished cast.JPG" alt="" /></span>The cast backpiece was a bit of an adventure. Modeling it in CAD took me quite a while, as I'd never used the form process before. I also wanted to be able to machine the back, make it more easily castable, and keep it relatively flat agains my back, so I had to do more slicing and processing to the model, especially as I was constantly changing the form. THe first time I tried to print the model it was about 50% the size I wanted. And when I managed to print the correct size, the printer disconnected in the middle and I had to glue two pieces together to finish it. Luckily for me, the organic nature of the piece, made it pretty easy to ram up, and the first cast turned out well enough that I used it in the final piece. I wanted it to contrast pretty heavily with the texture and shape of the wings, so I took it to a pretty high polish.</p>

                                <h4>Putting it All Together</h4>
                                <p><span class="image left" loading="lazy" decoding="async"><img src="images/ALA/upper wings full.jpg" alt="" /></span>Because of the size of the porject, and the number of pieces I had to assemble, I had to finish all the pieces before connecting them together. Of course, this makes the connection process somewhat nervewracking because I didn't want to mess up the finishes I had spent so long on. All of the sheet metal pieces were to be riveted together, and then screwed onto a back plate, which then screwed onto the cast backpiece. The backplate then takes most of the weight of the wings, hopefully keeping the helicoils in the cast piece in pretty good shape. The very last piece to this project was sewing a couple of straps from some scrap cotton I had. These had to be hand sewn onto the backplate because of their awkward positioning.</p>
